\textbf{School of Management and Labor Relations, Rutgers University}, New Brunswick, NJ, May 
2018--September 2018
\begin{itemize}
\item
Designed and implemented a web application to explore the unionization trends of registered 
nurses in the United States using Current Population Survey (CPS) data.
\item
The application allows the user to select, aggregate, and visualize the data to explore union 
membership and union contract coverage rates.
\item
The application was built using R and Shiny. It is currently available at:
